                    <p>After the death of V.I. Lenin, Joseph Stalin (1924-1953) became the head of the USSR. In the
                        country, there was restored the economy destroyed during the Civil War. There was set the task
                        of industrialization of the USSR, i.e. the creation of large-scale machine production in
                        industry.


                    </p>
                    <p>In the country there began the construction of plants, factories, power plants. The military
                        industry was created. Thus, there were laid the foundations for the victory of the USSR in the
                        Great Patriotic War.

                        At the same time, changes were taking place in agriculture. In the 1930s, in villages there was
                        carried out collectivization, i.e. the creation of large collective farms (kolkhozes). In
                        collective farms, people used machinery (cars, tractors). However, not all peasants wanted to
                        join collective farms; some of them wanted to work independently. The government applied
                        repression against peasants and forced many of them to settle in Siberia. The situation in
                        villages was difficult: grain production decreased; there began famine. Only in the second half
                        of the 1930s, the situation in agriculture began to improve.

                    <p>The results of the industrialization of the USSR were quite contradictory. Over the years, about
                        9,000 new plants and factories were built in the country. There emerged new industries:
                        automobile, tractor, chemical, aircraft, and others. In terms of industrial production, the
                        Soviet Union ranked second in the world after the USA.


                    </p>
                    <p>Industrialization changed the economies of all the national republics. For example, in Central
                        Asia there were built new canals, power plants, as well as the Turkestan-Siberian Railway
                        (Turksib), which connected Siberia with Central Asia and Kazakhstan.

                        Important changes took place in the life of Soviet society. There was no longer unemployment in
                        the USSR. People gained the right to free education and medical care. Workers gained the right
                        to annual leave and pensions, working women - the right to maternity leave. However, the living
                        standards of Soviet people were lower than in Western Europe and the USA.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        At that time, in the USSR there was a rigid political system of power. There was one party in
                        the country - the Bolshevik Party (from 1952 - the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU)).
                        At the same time, in the country there was established the regime of personal power (or
                        personality cult) of the party’s General Secretary — Joseph Stalin. The party established strict
                        control over the state and carried out repressions against various sectors of society. Many
                        people died. However, it was impossible to establish complete control of power over society.
