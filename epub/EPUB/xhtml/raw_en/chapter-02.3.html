                        In 1533, after the death of Vasily III, his three-year-old son Ivan IV (1533–1584) assumed the
                        throne. While he was a child, the country was ruled by the boyars.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In January 1547, Ivan IV assumed the title of Tsar. It was meant to strengthen the authority of
                        the ruler, to emphasize the continuity of his power from the Byzantine emperors.

                    <p>
                        In the summer of 1547, an uprising began in Moscow. It was terrible fires that became the reason
                        for the uprising. With great difficulty, the authorities managed to reassure the population of
                        the city. One of the results of the uprising was the policy of reforms pursued by the new
                        advisers of the tsar (Alexei Adashev, priest Sylvester, metropolitan Makariy).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reforms began with the first Zemsky Sobor in the country's history (1549). It consisted of
                        the Boyar Duma, higher clergy and nobility. Its goal was to reach agreement and unite various
                        groups of Russian society around the central power.

                        In the 1550s, there were created prikazes that managed certain spheres (for example, foreign
                        policy, court cases, etc.).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the 1550s, Ivan IV renounced the reform. The tsar wanted to gain unlimited power.
                        As a result, he dealt with his advisers and switched to a new policy, which was called
                        “oprichnina” (1565-1572).

                        This policy was aimed against the boyars and was characterized by repressions that affected
                        almost all strata of society. Due to this, the people gave the tsar the name “Ivan the
                        Terrible”. At that time, the Russian troops suffered a number of severe defeats in the Livonian
                        War, which Russia waged to get access to the Baltic Sea.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Tsar accused the boyars of treason, theft of public money, and violence against the people.
                        In 1570, the oprichnina troop conducted a campaign against Novgorod. As a result, more than 10
                        thousand people died. In 1571, the tsar failed to protect Moscow from the Crimean Tatars. The
                        Crimean Khan burned the capital. As a result of the military failures, in 1572 Ivan IV renounced
                        the oprichnina (i.e., the division of the country's territory, its troops and management).
                        However, the repressions continued until the death of the tsar.

                    <p>
                        The internal policy and long war led to a severe economic crisis. The life of the people was
                        very hard, many people died. People fled from the center to the outskirts and did not pay taxes.
                        All this weakened the state. In 1581, in order to overcome the crisis, the authorities abolished
                        St. George's Day (the only day in the year when it was possible to leave the master), which led
                        to the enslavement of peasants.

                    <p>
                        In foreign policy, Russia's top priority was to maintain national sovereignty. In addition, the
                        country lay between the West and the East; therefore, it was forced to pursue an active policy
                        in these two directions.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the east, during the clashes with the Kazan and Astrakhan khanates, the troops of Ivan IV
                        annexed Kazan (1552) and Astrakhan (1556). Thus, the Volga region became part of the Russian
                        state, and the entire Volga trade route fell under the control of Moscow.

                        Under Tsar Ivan the Terrible, there was launched the conquest of Siberia, which was mainly
                        peaceful. It began in 1582withthe campaign to Siberia by the Cossacks detachment led by ataman
                        Yermak. By the end of the XVI century, Western Siberia had become part of Russia.

                        Russia's striving for the access to the Baltic Sea, along which important trade routes passed,
                        led to the war with the Livonian Order (Livonian War, 1558-1583). Soon the Order was defeated,
                        but its lands fell under control of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Thus, Russia waged
                        a war against powerful European states, rather than a weak adversary. In addition, in the west
                        Russia fought with Sweden. As a result, Russia lost the war and failed to gain access to the
                        Baltic Sea.
