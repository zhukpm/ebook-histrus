                        At the beginning of the XX century, Russia was strengthening the alliance with France and Great
                        Britain. Its main opponents were Germany and Austria-Hungary. As a result, two groups of
                        countries were formed in Europe. They began to fight against each other.

                        On August 1, 1914, Germany declared war on Russia, then on France. Thus, the First World War
                        started for Russia. 38states of the world were involved in the war.

                        In 1914-1915, the Russian army fought against the German troops and their allies in Europe.
                        Later, Russia lost the western territories - Poland, part of Belarus and of the Baltics.
                        However, at the same time, it retained the main industrial, fuel and agricultural base.

                        As a result of the hostilities of 1916, many Russian soldiers and officers were wounded and
                        killed. One of the reasons for the failures was the poor command of the Russian army. The
                        officers and soldiers were tired of the war, they did not want to fight and die for unclear
                        objectives. The population of Russia was also tired of the bitter war. It was dissatisfied with
                        the power of the tsar. As a result, the First World War became one of the reasons for the
                        Russian Revolution of 1917.
