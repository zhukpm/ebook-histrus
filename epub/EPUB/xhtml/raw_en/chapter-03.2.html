                        After the Time of Troubles, already from the middle of the XVII century, thanks to the peaceful
                        work of the Russian people, there began the growth of agricultural production. It was due to the
                        development of fertile land in the center of Russia.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the towns there was gradually being restored craft production. The first Russian
                        manufactories appeared (by the end of the XVII century there were about 30 of them). The largest
                        trade center was Moscow; fairs were of great significance. Foreign trade was traditional for
                        Russia. It exported furs, grain, flax, leather, whereas it imported industrial products, tea,
                        etc. Sea trade with Europe in the north was carried out through the only port – Arkhangelsk; it
                        operated only a few months a year and could not satisfy the country's economic needs. Trade with
                        eastern countries was carried out through Astrakhan. Moreover, Russia did not have its own
                        fleet, and its foreign trade was in the hands of foreign merchants.

                        In the XVII century, there was established the social structure of Russian society, which was
                        consolidated by the Sobornoye Ulozheniye(legal code) of 1649. These were service class people,
                        who were in the public service, urban population and peasantry.

                        Peasants were the main part of the country's population; they were divided into free and
                        dependent (serfs), who by the end of the XVII century made up more than 70% of rural residents.

                        In the second half of the XVII century, the power of the tsar (autocracy) was strengthened. He
                        no longer needed the support of the Zemsky Sobors. The Boyar Duma lost its significance as well.
                        The tsar assembled the whole Duma less frequently; he discussed important issues with a narrow
                        circle of people close to him.

                        In the middle of the XVII century, the reform of the Russian Orthodox Church began. The reform
                        was caused by the desire of the state to strengthen the church. In addition, Russia tried to
                        unite all the Orthodox churches under its leadership, and service was conducted in them
                        according to the Greek rites.

                        The differences in the rites undermined the authority of the church. After Nikon was elected
                        Patriarch (1652), the reform began to be implemented, especially in the sphere of the rites. For
                        example, the tradition of crossing oneself with two fingers (two-fingered sign of the cross) was
                        replaced by the tradition of crossing oneself with three fingers (three-fingered sign of the
                        cross). The violent methods of implementing the reform led to the schism in the church. Some of
                        the believers remained faithful to the old rites (therefore, they were called Old Believers or
                        schismatics).

                        The XVII century was called the century of riots and popular unrest. There were many different
                        town uprisings at that time. The most massive rioting of the townspeople was the Moscow uprising
                        of 1648. It was caused by the tax reform, which raised prices for salt. The tsar reassured the
                        people with great difficulty. The Sobornoye Ulozheniye of 1649 met a number of the citizens’
                        requirements. In the interests of the service class people, there was completed the enslavement
                        of peasants.

                        The most massive popular rioting of the XVII century was the uprising led by Stepan Razin
                        (1667-1671). There were involved Don Cossacks and peasants who had fled from the serfdom to the
                        river Don. The rebels captured a number of Volga towns, but in October 1671 they were defeated
                        by the tsar’s forces. The chieftain, Stepan Razin, was later captured and executed.
