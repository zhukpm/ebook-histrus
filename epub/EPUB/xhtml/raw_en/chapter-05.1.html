                        The Patriotic War of 1812 took place during the reign of <span class="it">Alexander I</span>
                         (1801-1825). He was an
                        educated and smart ruler, but lack of staunchness prevented him from implementing the reforms
                        sought. He reigned in the conditions of war, which required huge costs and distracted from
                        internal transformations.

                    <p>
                        Above all, Alexander I tried to solve the peasant issue. He forbade giving state peasants to
                        landowners (1801), which limited serfdom. In 1803, he allowed serfs to gain freedom and land for
                        money, but with the consent of a landowner. Serfs in the Baltics gained personal freedom.
                        However, Alexander I did not dare to abolish serfdom.

                        , in that period there occurred the expansion of the territory
                        of the Russian Empire. At the very beginning of the XIX century, Christian Georgia became part
                        of the country. It feared that it might be captured by the Islamic states (Iran and Turkey).
                        After the victory over Iran, the territories of Dagestan and Northern Azerbaijan were annexed to
                        Russia.

                    <p>
                        Of particular importance for Russia was the European direction. When Napoleon, who was trying to
                        establish his dominance in Europe, came to power in France, the international situation got
                        complicated. Russia in alliance with England and Austria stood up to Napoleon. Napoleon began to
                        prepare for the war againstRussia.

                        , the huge Napoleon’s army (450 thousand people) crossed the borders of Russia.
                        The Russian troops were inferior in quantity (300 thousand people); moreover, they were divided
                        into separate armies. Napoleon planned to defeat them separately and subjugate Russia.

                        However, the Russian armies were able to unite near Smolensk. Alexander I appointed <span class="it">M.I. Kutuzov</span>

                        Commander-in-Chief. Peasants, townspeople, representatives of different nationalities began to
                        rise against the invaders. The war became <span class="it">patriotic</span>
                        .

                    <p>
                        Given the patriotic rise in the army, Kutuzov decided to give the enemy a
                        decisive battle. On <span class="emphasis">August 26, 1812</span>
                        , there began the <span class="it">Battle of Borodino</span>
                        , known as the bloodiest
                        in the history of the Napoleonic Wars. Both parties suffered heavy losses. Napoleon was not able
                        to defeat the Russian army. But the Russian troops had no strength to continue the battle
                        either. By Kutuzov’s order, they left Moscow.

                        Napoleon entered Moscow, and from that moment fires began in the city. Not having enough food,
                        the French began to pillage the civilians. Napoleon tried to make peace with Russia, but
                        Alexander I did not accept his proposal. Then Napoleon left Moscow and began a retreat
                        southward. At that time, partisan detachments fought against Napoleon. In the battle near the
                        Berezina River (November 28), the French army was virtually defeated. On December 25, Alexander
                        I issued a manifesto on the end of the Patriotic war.

                        In January 1813, the Russian troops crossed the border and, with the support of the allied
                        armies (Prussia and Austria had sided with Russia), defeated Napoleon. The Patriotic War of 1812
                        rallied the Russian society and caused the national conscious-raising.

                        After defeating Napoleon’s army, Alexander I believed in the power of Russia and renounced any
                        important reforms. Only Poland, which became part of Russia, got the constitution in 1815. In
                        1822, Alexander I returned landlords the right to exile their peasants to Siberia and send them
                        to penal servitude.
