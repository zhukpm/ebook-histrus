                    <p>After the beginning of World War I in 1914, Russia's economic situation became worse, and a
                        political crisis broke out in the country. Workers, peasants and soldiers opposed the tsar and
                        the government.

                    <p>It became the cause of the Russian Revolution. It began in February 1917 with the revolutionary
                        actions in Petrograd. After Petrograd, the revolution won in Moscow and further throughout the
                        country.

                    . The people
                        demanded the transfer of land to peasants, factories–to workers; they also demanded the end of
                        the war. The Provisional Government was overthrown. It no longer governed the country. The
                        Bolsheviks came to power. They created the Bolshevik government - <span class="it">the Council of People's

                        In Russia, there was established the power of the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies
                        (Soviet power).

                        As a result of the revolution, important socio-economic changes took place in the country.
                        Private ownership, including that of land, was abolished. All plants, factories and banks became
                        state property (they were nationalized). An eight-hour working day was introduced;child labor
                        was prohibited; equal rights of women and men were proclaimed.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1918, the church was separated from the state, and the school was separated from the church.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        The Bolsheviks proclaimed the equality of all nations and nationalities and the right of nations
                        to self-determination. In December 1917, Poland and Finland gained the right to independence. In
                        January 1918, there was created the <span class="it">Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic</span>
                         (RSFSR). In
                        March 1918, Soviet Russia signed a peace agreement with Germany and came out of the First World
                        War, which for other countries ended in November 1918.

                        However, after the Bolsheviks came to power, in Russia there broke out the Civil War. At the
                        same time, other foreign states began to intervene in the internal life of Russia. The main
                        military force in the fight against the Bolsheviks and Soviet power was the White Movement
                        (White Army). The White Army consisted of former officers of the tsarist army and members of
                        various political parties. It fought against the Red Army, which had been created by the
                        Bolsheviks.

                    <p>
                        In 1921, the Civil War ended with the victory of the Bolsheviks. Soviet power was established in
                        Central Asia and the Caucasus.
