                        At the beginning of the XX century, the Russian Empire included the Baltics, Ukraine, Belarus,
                        Poland, Finland, Transcaucasia, Kazakhstan and Central Asia. The population was 159 million
                        people. Over 100 nations and nationalities lived in the territory of the empire. In Russia,
                        there were 57% of non-Russians. A significant part of the population was Christians; most of
                        them (about 75%) were Orthodox. In the western regions of Russia, there were mostly Catholics
                        and Protestants. In different areas, there also lived a large group of Muslims. A part of the
                        population professed Judaism and Buddhism.

                    <p>
                        In Russia, most inhabitants were peasants. Therefore, agriculture was developed. The Russian
                        Empire ranked first in the world in grain production. It sold abroad 25% of the world exports of
                        grain. In the country, there were also grown industrial crops: flax, sugar beets, tobacco. In
                        Central Asia, a lot of cotton was grown. Livestock production was developing. A significant part
                        of land belonged to landowners. In the central regions of Russia there dominated communal
                        ownership of land.

                        Industry in Russia was developing rapidly. The country ranked4-5th in the world in terms of
                        industrial production, but it lagged behind the advanced countries of the West. A large role in
                        the development of the Russian industry was played by foreign companies. <span class="it">Banks</span>
                         were created. The
                        main one was the State Bank.</p>

                        In Russia, <span class="it">domestic</span>
                         and <span class="it">foreign</span>
                          trade was actively developing. Russia’s main trading partners
                        were Germany and Great Britain. Abroad, Russia bought machinery and equipment. An important role
                        in the development of the country was played by railway and water transport. Russia ranked
                        second in the world (the USA ranked first) in terms of the length of railway lines.

                        At the same time, in Russia there remained absolute monarchy. It was the emperor that determined
                        the policy of the government. After the death of Tsar Alexander III, his son <span class="it">Nicholas II</span>

                        (1894-1917) assumed the throne. Emperor Nicholas II was a conservative. He believed that reforms
                        were dangerous for the existing order, and therefore, he did not want any changes. Nicholas II
                        was the last Russian emperor. He was an educated man, he was very fond of his family, but he was
                        indecisive and insufficiently prepared for governing the country.

                        At the beginning of the XX century, in Russia the agrarian and labor issues were not resolved.
                        Social inequality, political powerlessness, and the worsening of living conditions prompted
                        people to oppose the existing order in the country. At that time, Nicholas II decided to start a
                        war against Japan. He hoped the war would help strengthen his power.

                        The Russo-Japanese War began on January 25, 1904. The Japanese fleet attacked Russian ships off
                        the coast of Japan (there was the Russian fortress of Port Arthur there). Japan defeated the
                        Russian navy. In the course of the battles on land, the Russian troops could not stop the
                        advance of the Japanese. In 1905, the war resulted in the victory of Japan. The defeat was
                        mainly due to the weakness of the Russian military command, as well as poor condition of
                        military equipment. During the war, many Russian sailors and officers perished. The war
                        aggravated the political and economic crisis that set in motion the First Russian Revolution.
