                    <p>In 1985, M.S. Gorbachev became the leader of the USSR (1985-1991). There began economic and
                        political reforms in the country. That period was called perestroika (restructuring).

                    </p>
                    <p>In the economy, the task was set to accelerate the pace of economic development, primarily in
                        engineering, and to improve discipline. There began the fight against alcoholism. Product
                        quality control was enhanced. There was developing individual (private) labor activity of
                        citizens in various fields.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, from 1990 the economic situation became worse: the country lacked food and industrial
                        goods.

                        At the same time, in the USSR there was being implemented a reform of the political system. A
                        multi-party system began to take shape. In addition to the CPSU, new parties were formed -
                        social-democratic, liberal, national-patriotic ones.

                    <p>
                        The system of the USSR government changed. The Congress of People's Deputies began to work
                        again. It was the highest legislative body of the country. The Congress formed the Supreme
                        Soviet of the USSR (in fact, parliament).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In March 1990, M.S. Gorbachev became the first President of the USSR. In1991, there were held
                        presidential elections in the union republics.

                    <p>
                        During the years of perestroika, important changes took place in the social life of the USSR.
                        There was more freedom; information became available. People openly expressed their opinions at
                        rallies, referendums, and elections. It contributed to the development of the spiritual life of
                        Soviet people.

                        It was literature that played a special role. Writers and poets wrote about the problems that
                        had not been discussed previously. Among them were the results of the Great October Socialist
                        Revolution, the role of Lenin and Stalin in the history of the country, the repressions, etc.

                        There were changes in the position of religion in the USSR. Christian culture and culture of
                        other religions were developing freely; temples were returned to believers. Representatives of
                        the clergy could openly express their opinions in the Soviet press, on radio, television, and
                        speak about the problems of education.

                    <p>However, at the end of perestroika a crisis began in the country. The opponents of Gorbachev
                        (including President of the RSFSR B.N. Yeltsin) demanded more radical reforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During perestroika, changes took place in the foreign policy of the USSR. The relations between
                        the East and the West improved. In February 1989, the Soviet Union completed the withdrawal of
                        its troops from Afghanistan. After that there were normalized the relations with China.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, there began the crisis of the socialist system. In Central and Eastern Europe,
                        the communist regimes were abolished. Thus, the USSR lost its allies in the socialist camp. The
                        international position of the Soviet Union weakened.
