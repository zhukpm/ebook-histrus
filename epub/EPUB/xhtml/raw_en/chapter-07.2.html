                        In December 1922, a new state was formed in the territory of the former Russian Empire - the
                        Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The USSR initially included the RSFSR, Ukraine,
                        Byelorussia, as well as the Transcaucasian republics (Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan). In
                        1924, the first USSR Constitution was adopted. The USSR was federation. There were established
                        All-Union public authorities: the executive body - the government, which was called the
                        Sovnarkom (Council of People's Commissars) of the USSR (from 1946 - the Council of Ministers of
                        the USSR), and the legislative body - the All-Union Congress of Soviets(from 1936 - the Supreme
                        Council of the USSR (parliament)). Each republic also had its own (republican) authorities.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        There appeared Soviet symbols - the flag and coat of arms of the USSR.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        They depicted a red star, a sickle and a hammer. The state coat of arms of the USSR symbolized
                        the union of workers and peasants, the voluntary association of equal union republics.

                        In 1943, the USSR anthem was approved (the lyrics were written by S.V. Mikhalkov and G.A.
                        El-Registan (the real name is G.A. Ureklyan); the music was composed by A.V. Aleksandrov). The
                        music of the USSR anthem later became the anthem of modern Russia.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        During the 1920-1930s within the territory of Central Asia there were formed the Turkmen, Uzbek,
                        Tajik, Kyrgyz, Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republics (SSR); in Transcaucasia - the Armenian,
                        Azerbaijan and Georgian SSR. Later, the USSR included the three Baltic republics and the
                        Moldavian SSR.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        The formation of the USSR helped to develop the economy, education, and culture in the new
                        republics.

                        The USSR was a multinational state, with more than 120 languages. Formally, in the USSR there
                        were no official or state languages (with the exception of Armenia and Georgia), and all the
                        languages of the USSR were equal in their rights. National schools and theaters were opened in
                        all the republics, and literature was published in the languages of the peoples of the USSR.
                        There appeared national intelligentsia. In the republics, national academies of sciences were
                        created.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, in the USSR it was the Russian language that was the language of interethnic
                        communication through which representatives of different ethnic groups within one multinational
                        state communicated with each other.

                        The Soviet national policy was controversial. On the one hand, national differences persisted,
                        friendship between peoples strengthened, economic, cultural, kin relations grew, and the number
                        of interethnic marriages increased. On the other hand, national relations were affected by the
                        policy of centralization, restriction of the powers of the republics, and strict subordination
                        to their party leadership. Despite these problems, the USSR retained its strength as a single
                        state until 1991. The peoples of the USSR together overcame difficulties and tragedies; they
                        made a joint contribution to the victory in the Great Patriotic War.
