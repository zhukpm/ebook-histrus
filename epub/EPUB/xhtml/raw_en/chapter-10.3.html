                        The Russian Federation pursued its foreign policy in difficult international conditions. Russia had lost its allies in Eastern and Central Europe. Near the borders of the CIS, armed conflicts took place. The government set a task to restore the position of Russia as a strong state. Russia remained the permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations (UN). It took over the control over the Soviet nuclear weapons.

                        Due to the collapse of the USSR and the communist system, the Cold War ended. Russia and the USA said they no longer considered each other as enemies. Russia supported the Americans in the fight against world terrorism, and along with Western countries it fought against drug trafficking.

                        The economic cooperation of the Russian Federation with foreign countries expanded. In 1994, Russia was accepted into the G7 – the Group of7 leading Western countries (which includes the USA, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Japan). As a result, there was formed the G8 of the leading economic powers. Russia also became a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

                        There were developing ties of Russia with the CIS countries. In 1993, the CIS Charter was adopted. In 1995, there was established the Customs Union between Russia and Belarus; Kazakhstan also joined it. In 1999, an agreement was signed on the formation of the Union State of Russia and Belarus. There were concluded agreements on military cooperation of Russia with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.

                        However, during that period integration within the CIS was developing in an extremely controversial way. Russia faced the task of strengthening its influence within the CIS and developing ties with the CIS countries.
