                        Peter I became an example for Russian Empress Catherine II (1762-1796). She was of German
                        origin, but she sincerely loved Russia. The Empress wanted to raise the level of the economic
                        and cultural development of the country and to strengthen its position in the world. She was
                        smart and well-educated. She believed in the power of education, and wanted everyone in her
                        state to abide by the laws. It is noteworthy that she tried to avoid harsh methods of
                        management.

                        Catherine II condemned serfdom, but she realized that its abolition would cause discontent among
                        the nobility, which could dethrone her. Therefore, during the years of her reign serfdom did
                        strengthen.

                        In 1767, Catherine wanted to adopt a new code of laws. To this end, she convened the Legislative
                        Commission with the participation of deputies of all estates, but soon she dissolved it under
                        the pretext of the outbreak of the war with Turkey.

                    <p>
                        In 1775, Catherine carried out the reform of local government. According to the territorial
                        principle, Russia was divided into 50 provinces. Subsequently, the number of provinces
                        increased, but the main provisions of the reform remained unchanged until 1917.

                    <p>
                        The policy of Catherine II in the socio-economic sphere was contradictory. On the one hand,
                        serfdom was strengthened (for example, state peasants (i.e. personally free) could be given to
                        landowners). However, at the same time, there were taken liberal measures. Representatives of
                        all estates gained the right to engage in entrepreneurship. It contributed to the development of
                        industrial production.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1785, the rights of the nobility were enshrined (Charter to the nobility): the right to land
                        and peasants, exemption from compulsory service, etc. It is no accident that the era of the
                        reign of Catherine II was called the “Golden Age” of the Russian nobility. Urban residents also
                        gained limited rights (Charter to the towns).

                        During the reign of Catherine II, Russia significantly expanded its borders and gained access to
                        the Black Sea. In addition to the new lands in the south (Novorossiya or New Russia), the
                        country gained trade routes necessary for its economic development.

                        As a result of the wars against Turkey in the 1770-1780s, Russia annexed the territory of the Northern Black Sea Region,
                        including the Crimean Peninsula (1783), where the base of the Black Sea Fleet - the city of
                        Sevastopol - was established. It was Russian commander A.V. Suvorov who never lost a single
                        battle and Admiral F.F. Ushakov that made a particular contribution to the defeat of the Turkish
                        troops.

                    <p>
                        As a result, during the reign of Catherine II, the empire expanded significantly. In the west,
                        it annexed the territories of Right-bank Ukraine, Belarus and parts of the Baltics. The Caucasus
                        became part of Russia, which took Eastern Georgia under protection. There began the development
                        of the Black Sea steppes. The international position of the country strengthened. Due to these
                        successes, the contemporaries called their empress Catherine the Great.
