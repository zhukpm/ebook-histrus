                        By the end of the XVII century, in Russia the tsar’s power had strengthened, the population size
                        had
                        increased, and the borders of the state had expanded. However, the country was increasingly
                        lagging
                        behind Western Europe. In order to overcome the economic, military and cultural backwardness, it
                        was
                        necessary to carry out reforms and to establish trade relations with the leading countries of
                        the world. However, the development of foreign trade was impossible without
                        access to the Baltic Sea.

                        It was <span class="it">Peter I</span>
                         (1682-1725), one of the most famous historical figures of the country that played
                        a
                        huge role in solving the problems facing Russia. He always worked for the good of the fatherland
                        (therefore he was called tsar-worker); he appreciated business qualities of people, regardless
                        of
                        their origin. It was serving the state that Peter made the purpose of his rule. However, to
                        achieve
                        his goals, he often used the most severe measures.

                        In <span class="emphasis">1700</span>
                        , in order to gain access to the Baltic Sea, Russia began a bitter and lengthy war
                        against
                        Sweden - the <span class="it">Northern War</span>
                         (1700-1721).During that war, Peter I created a new army and navy and
                        transformed the system of state management. The reforms in the field of culture and life created
                        the
                        conditions for the development of science, education, literature, etc.

                        Over the years of the reign of Peter I, over 200 manufactories were founded in the country. The
                        Urals region became the center of the metallurgical industry, and in 1725 Russia ranked third in
                        the
                        world in the import of cast iron.

                    <p>
                        As industry was growing, there emerged a shortage of labor force at the factories. Therefore, in
                        1721 Peter allowed entrepreneurs, including non-noblemen, to buy serfs for the factories.

                        , founded in 1703 on the Baltic Sea, became the center of foreign trade, and Peter
                        I
                        turned it into the new capital of the country. The state strengthened the position of the
                        nobility.
                        The decree of 1714 gave the right to inherit the estate only to one of the sons, which forced
                        the
                        rest to serve the state. The Law of 1722 (“Table of Ranks”) determined the procedure of
                        performing
                        civil service. Whether a nobleman could get a position depended on his education and personal
                        abilities.

                        The tsar carried out the reforms with the help of peasants (92% of the population). Peasants
                        built
                        fortresses, factories, the new capital; they served in the army.

                        In 1724, a new tax was introduced. Every man, regardless of age (except for noblemen and priests
                        that were privileged estates), was to pay taxes. As a result, tax burden increased two- or
                        threefold. To prevent serfs from fleeing from their masters, the passport system was introduced.

                        During the reform of 1708-1710, the country was divided into 8 <span class="it">provinces</span>
                         headed by governors
                        that
                        were appointed by the tsar. There began the reform of the central government bodies. In 1711,
                        instead of the Boyar Duma, the <span class="it">Senate</span>
                         was established. It performed the highest regulatory,
                        judicial
                        and law-advisory functions. In 1717-1722, there were formed colleges: Military, Foreign, and
                        others.
                        In 1721, the patriarchate was abolished. The <span class="it">Spiritual College</span>
                         (later the <span class="it">Synod</span>
                         ), led by a civil
                        official that was appointed by the tsar, began to rule the church.
