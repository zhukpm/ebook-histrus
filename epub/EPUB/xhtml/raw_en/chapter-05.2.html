                        The renunciation of Alexander I to carry out reforms led to the fact that part of the liberal
                        nobility decided to oppose the power of the tsar (autocracy).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In December 1825, there took place an uprising of the noblemen-revolutionaries (hence their name
                        Decembrists). Almost all Decembrists were officers who together with soldiers had liberated
                        Russia and Western Europe from Napoleon. Their main aim was to save the Russian people from
                        serfdom and autocracy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The noblemen no longer believed the tsar. They began to create secret organizations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The “Southern Society” led by P.I. Pestel and S.I. Muravyov-Apostol operated in Ukraine. The
                        society planned to eliminate autocracy and serfdom, to establish the republic, and give equal
                        rights to all citizens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The “Northern Society” led by N.M. Muravyov and K.F. Ryleyev operated in St. Petersburg. This
                        society advocated the introduction of constitutional monarchy (that is, the power of the tsar
                        limited by the constitution), the abolition of serfdom; it also advocated the rights and
                        freedoms of citizens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In November 1825, Alexander I died. The secret societies decided to take advantage of his death.
                        They planned to assemble guard regiments in the Senate Square and force the Senate to adopt “The
                        Manifesto to the Russian People” on the introduction of freedoms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On December 14, about 3 and a half thousand rebels gathered in the Senate Square in St.
                        Petersburg (where the monument to Peter I is located). New emperor Nicholas I (1825-1855) found
                        out about the plans of the revolutionaries and surrounded the square with loyal troops. They
                        began to fire guns and shoot at the rebels. Then mass arrests began. Five leaders of the
                        uprising were hanged. Many rebels were exiled to Siberia.

                        The Decembrist uprising was the first organized armed rebellion against autocracy and serfdom.
                        Its peculiarity lay in the fact that it was noblemen that wanted to change the existing
                        practices in Russia, despite the fact that they occupied a privileged position in society.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the contrary, Emperor Nicholas I wanted to strengthen the autocracy, to prevent revolution in
                        Russia and accelerate the development of the country.

                        He highly estimated strong power, the Orthodox faith, and Russian customs. Under Nicholas I, the
                        position of state peasants improved: their land holdings increased; there were opened rural
                        schools and hospitals. In 1851, there was opened the Petersburg-Moscow railway. In general,
                        during the reign of Nicolas I, the state control over all spheres of life intensified, which
                        hindered the development of the country.

                    <p>
                        Under Nicholas I, after the successful wars against Persia and Turkey, the territory of Eastern
                        Armenia became part of Russia, and at the end of the XIX century, significant territories of
                        Western Armenia integrated into Russia. The Russian authorities organized mass resettlement of
                        Armenians from Persia and Turkey to Transcaucasia.

                        In the second half of the XIX century, the most important international event for Russia was the
                        Crimean War (1853-1856). It was caused by the struggle of the European powers for the partition
                        of Turkey’s territory. In that war Russia was opposed by the coalition of the leading European
                        states (France and England) as well as Turkey. Therefore, it was defeated. Under the terms of
                        the Paris Peace Treaty (1856), Russia lost the right to have navy and fortifications on the
                        Black Sea. The main reason for the defeat of Russia was its economic lag behind European
                        countries. But the defeat in the war forced the authorities to begin preparing reforms in
                        Russia.
