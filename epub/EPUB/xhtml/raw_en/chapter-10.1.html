                        Russia is a multinational country. Representatives of 160 nationalities live there. Most people
                        profess Christianity (mainly Orthodoxy). The traditional religions are also Islam, Judaism,
                        Buddhism.

                        At the same time, Russia is a secular state. Life in Russia is governed by civil rather than
                        religious laws. The official language in the country is Russian. The republics within the
                        Russian Federation also have the right to use their state languages, along with Russian. For
                        example, in Chechnya it is the Chechen language, in Buryatia–the Buryat language, in
                        Tatarstan–the Tatar language.

                        On <span class="emphasis">June 12, 1990</span>
                        , there was adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the RSFSR. This day
                        became a state holiday – Russia Day. In 1991,  <span class="it">B.N. Yeltsin</span>
                         became the first President of Russia
                        (1991-1999). Economic reforms began in the country. The main goal of the reforms was to
                        establish a market economy in Russia.
                    </p>

                    <p>The results of the reforms were very different. In the country, there were introduced free prices
                         <span class="it">(</span>
                         <span class="it">price liberalization)</span>
                        . There began privatization, i.e. the transfer of state property to
                        private property. The reforms created new opportunities for people. Some of them got good jobs
                        at state and private enterprises. There appeared private business in the banking and financial
                        sectors; a new class appeared - the middle class which supports market reforms. It helped to
                        develop the economy.

                        There appeareda lot of different goods and food. However, the cost of goods became higher, wages
                        decreased. As a result of the economic reforms, the population was divided into the rich and the
                        poor; many people's lives became worse.

                    <p>
                        By the end of the 1990s, the economic indicators in Russia had worsened. The production of
                        manufactured goods and food decreased. There began the demographic crisis: over the decade of
                        the reforms the population of Russia also decreased.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the influence of the economic problems in the country, people began to protest against
                        price increase, closing of factories and plants. The problems in implementing the reforms led to
                        the weakening of the state.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In August 1999, <span class="it">V.V. Putin</span>
                         became the new Prime Minister. By that time, the economy of Russia had
                        become weaker than in 1990, i.e. before the collapse of the USSR.
