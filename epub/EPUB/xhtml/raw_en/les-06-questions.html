                                        At the beginning of the XX century, the Russian Empire included the Baltics, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Finland, Transcaucasia, Kazakhstan and Central Asia. 159 million people lived in Russia. Non-Russians accounted for 57% of the total number of people living in the country. Most people were Orthodox Christians. In the western regions of the country, there lived Catholics and Protestants. Many Muslims lived in different regions of the country. A small part of people professed Buddhism and Judaism.

                                        <p>At the beginning of the XX century, most people in Russia were peasants. Therefore, agriculture was developed, and it was the basis of the Russian economy. At that time, Russia exported a lot of grain abroad. In the country there were grown other agricultural crops as well: flax, sugar beets, tobacco. In Central Asia, cotton was grown for Russian textile factories. Certainly, there was also developing livestock farming, which provided people with meat and various dairy products. However, peasants had little land of their own; a significant part of land belonged to landlords.

                                        </p><p>Russia’s industry was developing rapidly. However, the country lagged behind the advanced powers of the world. Foreign capital played an important role in the development of industry. At that time, trade was developing in Russia as well. Russia traded with Germany, Great Britain and other countries. Russia imported machinery and equipment for factories. An important role in the development of the economy was played by railway and water transport. Many new railways were built in Russia.</p>

                                        <p>At the beginning of 1905, in Russia there began to intensify the revolutionary struggle of the people against the tsar and his government. Especially many people (two million people) took part in the strike in October. People’s protests against the emperor and the government were all over Russia. Therefore, this process was called the “All-Russian October Political Strike.” All over Russia, there began protests of workers and peasants.

At the same time, in the country there was created the Russian parliament - the State Duma.
                                        </p><p>In June 1907, the First Russian Revolution ended. Certainly, the revolution was defeated. However, there were positive results as well. There began the agricultural (agrarian) reform. Thanks to the reform, important changes took place in Russian agriculture: the country began to sell more grain abroad than before. Nevertheless, the situation of peasants remained difficult. Peasants did not have enough land. A significant part of it remained in the hands of landowners.)</p>

                                        At the end of the XIX century, in the western and southern regions of Russia there emerged the first national parties. Later, all-Russian revolutionary parties appeared: the party of Russian Socialists-Revolutionaries (SRs) and the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP). These parties opposed the tsar, advocated improving living standards of peasants and workers and preparing a revolution. The RSDLP actually split into two parties: the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. V. Lenin became the leader of the Bolshevik party. After the Manifesto of October 17, 1905, in Russia there were created liberal and monarchist parties. The liberals opposed the revolution and advocated reforms. The monarchist parties defended the absolute power of the monarch and the Russian national traditions.

                                        <p>At the beginning of the XX century, in international politics Russia had the most active relations with European countries. In Europe, Russia strengthened its alliance with Great Britain and France. The main opponents of the alliance were Germany and Austria-Hungary. Therefore, there were formed two blocs of countries, which fought against each other.
                                           </p><p> On August 1, 1914, Germany started a war against Russia, and then against France. Thus, the First World War began for Russia. It involved 38 countries. A lot of soldiers, officers, civilians of Russia were wounded and killed. The war lasted several years. The army and people of Russia got tired of that brutal, bloody war. People desired peace. Therefore, the First World War was one of the reasons for the Russian Revolution in 1917.</p>

                                            At the beginning of the XX century, important events and changes took place in Russian culture. The education system was developing. In Russia, there were opened many public and vocational schools where young people could acquire different professions. For example, there appeared mining, railway, and commercial schools. The government established new state institutions where people could get higher education; there appeared private universities.

                                            Science was developing. Even at that time, scientists were engaged in environmental problems (V.I. Vernadsky); medicine and technology continued to develop. At that time, Russia began to build its aircraft (N. E. Zhukovsky), to make cars.

                                            Writers and poets worked very actively. Some of them wrote about the real life problems, about ordinary people (A.P. Chekhov, M. Gorky). Others - A. Blok, A. Bely, M. Tsvetaeva - wrote lyrical works in which they showed the feelings of people.

                                            Painting was developing. At that time, I.E. Repin, A.M. Vasnetsov, M.V. Nesterov, V.A. Serov created their beautiful paintings.

                                            Theatrical and musical art was developing very intensively. The most famous were the opera and ballet theaters - the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow and the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg. At that time among the musicians, especially famous were S.V. Rachmaninov, A.N. Scriabin, as well as opera singer F.I. Chaliapin. At the same time, the whole world admired the Russian ballet.
