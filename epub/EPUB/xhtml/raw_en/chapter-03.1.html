                        At the beginning of the XVII century, there was a deep crisis in Russian society, which was
                        called the “Time of Troubles”. The main event of the era was the civil war (armed hostilities of
                        one part of society against another). In addition, foreign troops invaded Russia.

                    <p>
                        The crisis was largely caused by the consequences of the policy of oprichnina: worsening of the
                        economic situation; tax increase; enslavement of peasants.

                        After the death of Ivan the Terrible, his sick son Fyodor Ivanovich (1584-1598) was at the head
                        of the state. During his reign, the country was actually ruled by Boris Godunov. In 1591,
                        Tsarevich Dmitry (the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible) died. In 1598, Fyodor Ivanovich died
                        without issue.

                    <p>
                        Thus, the dynasty of Moscow sovereigns ceased to exist, which led to a political crisis. It was
                        aggravated due to the fact that the Zemsky Sobor elected Boris Godunov to the throne. For the
                        first time in the country, the “Zemsky” (elected) tsar assumed the throne.

                        The successful start of his reign was interrupted by a natural disaster. In 1601-1602, the crops
                        were lost, which led to a terrible famine. People accused Tsar Boris Godunov of their troubles.
                        There appeared rumors about the miraculous salvation of Tsarevich Dmitry. There were impostors
                        who called themselves his name. People considered them saviors who could save the country from
                        disasters and restore justice and order.

                    <p>
                        The first impostor was Grigory Otrepyev; the people called him False Dmitry I. He impersonated
                        the son of Ivan IV. In 1605, the tsar’s army went over to the side of False Dmitry I. Soon, his
                        troops occupied Moscow. However, the people quickly got disappointed with the new tsar. There
                        were still high taxes and serfdom in the country. All this led to the overthrow and
                        assassination of False Dmitry I in May 1606.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, rumors were spread all over the country about the new miraculous salvation of Dmitry.
                        In the summer of 1607, there appeared False Dmitry II, supported by the Polish nobility. He also
                        approached the capital with the army; foreigners pillaged the people, which caused hatred for
                        the Poles and the impostor. Eventually he was also assassinated.

                    <p>
                        In September 1610, the Polish troops entered Moscow. It caused the rise of patriotism and
                        religious feelings of the Russian people; it made them forget the discords and unite for the
                        sake of saving the state and faith.

                    <p>
                        In February 1611, the First Militia was created; it consisted of the detachments of noblemen,
                        Cossacks, and serving Tatars (it was a volunteer army to help the regular army). However, due to
                        the internal differences, the militia broke up. Then there was created the Second Militia under
                        the leadership of Nizhny Novgorod headman Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Mikhaylovich Pozharsky.

                        The Second Militia was well prepared, and on October 26, 1612 it liberated Moscow from the
                        Polish troops. Now this day (November 4, New Style Calendar) is celebrated as a national holiday
                        of Russia - National Unity Day. It has this name because it was thanks to the unity of all the
                        estates and peoples of Russia that it became possible to save the country.

                        In February 1613, it was Mikhail Fyodorovich (Romanov) who became the new tsar. He was elected
                        at the Zemsky Sobor, in which representatives of almost all estates took part.

                        Russia overcame the Time of Troubles. Large territories were lost, many people died. The economy
                        was ruined. The international position of the country worsened sharply. Russia was isolated, its
                        military potential decreased. Only thanks to patriotism and sacrifice of the people, it was
                        possible to save the Russian state from the collapse.
