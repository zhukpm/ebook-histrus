                        After the end of the Second World War, the authority of the USSR in the world rose. At the same
                        time, a conflict occurred between the two most powerful countries - the USSR and the USA, which
                        had nuclear weapons. Thus, the Cold War began.

                    <p>
                        After the war, the main task for the USSR was the restoration of the economy. 6,200 plants and
                        factories were built and restored. There was largely developed heavy industry. The military
                        industry was strengthened. In the difficult conditions, collective farmers provided the country
                        with food.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        In the post-war period, the country was in a difficult political situation. The party leadership
                        controlled the life of the people. The personality cult of Stalin was maintained.

                     (1953-1964) became the leader of the party and
                        state. He criticized the personality cult of Stalin and eliminated the repression system. It
                        contributed to the social upsurge in the country and development of culture.
                        </p>
                    <p>There occurred important changes in the economy of the USSR. Above all, some tasks in the sphere
                        of agriculture were solved: taxes on peasant farming were reduced, and purchase prices for
                        agricultural products were increased. There began the development of new lands (virgin soils) in
                        Siberia and Kazakhstan. The salary of workers and employees increased. Housing construction was
                        actively developing. More than 50 million people received new apartments.

                    <p>However, Khrushchev made many economic and political mistakes. Thus, in 1954, on his initiative
                        and without a referendum, the Supreme Council of the USSR adopted the decree on the transfer of
                        the Crimean peninsula (then it was the Crimean region) from the RSFSR to the Ukrainian SSR. This
                        decision laid the future contradictions in the relationship between Russia and Ukraine.

                        gas and military industries. The population got free housing, education, and medical treatment.
                        However, in the 1970s the situation in the industry and agriculture worsened. New reforms were
                        needed.
