                                        In the second half of the XIV century, in alliance with other Russian princes, Grand Duke of Moscow Dmitry Ivanovich (1359-1389) began to fight against the Golden Horde. In 1380, in the Battle of Kulikovo on the river Don, the Russian soldiers united by the common faith, common goal and common leadership, for the first time inflicted a major defeat on the Golden Horde army, and Moscow Prince Dmitry, who had united the Russian princes to fight against the Golden Horde, began to be called Donskoy. The gathering of the Russian lands around Moscow was completed under Ivan III the Great (1462-1505). During the reign of Ivan the Great, there began the history of the Tsardom of Russia.

                                        At that time Russia was an agricultural country, peasants accounted for 90% of the population. Harvests were very low, because Russia had severe climate and barren land. However, the unification of peasants into communities, their mutual help, Orthodox morality, which taught them to live not for wealth, but according to conscience, helped peasants to survive together. At that time, towns were actively developing, but their population was small. Russia's economy lagged behind the western one: it needed to develop maritime trade with European countries.

                                        Ivan IV (the Terrible) became the first Russian Tsar in 1547. The years of his reign can be nominally divided into the following stages: the period of reforms, the convening of the first Zemsky Sobor in 1549, the purpose of which was to unite Russian society around the tsar; the period of unlimited power, or the period of the oprichnina (1565-1572); the period after the oprichnina (1572-1584). The tsar’s domestic policy led to a severe economic crisis, the impoverishment of the population and enslavement of peasants.

                                        In foreign policy, the main task of Russia, which liberated itself from the Golden Horde’s power only at the end of the XV century, was the preservation of sovereignty. The geographical position of the country, which was located between the West and East, required active actions in these two directions simultaneously. Under Tsar Ivan the Terrible there began the conquest of Siberia, which was mostly peaceful. Russia’s striving to gain access to the Baltic Sea led to the war against Poland and Sweden (the Livonian War), which Russia lost.

There was completed the construction of the Moscow Kremlin. In the middle of the XVI century, by order of Ivan IV, on Red Square there was built the Pokrovsky Cathedral, which is known worldwide as Saint Basil's Cathedral. Great Russian artist Andrei Rublev painted the world-famous icon “The Trinity”.</p>
