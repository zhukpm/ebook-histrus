                                        After the death of Stalin, N.S. Khrushchev became the leader of the party and state. He criticized the personality cult of Stalin and eliminated the system of repressions. In the economy, some tasks in the sphere of agriculture were solved. Khrushchev reduced taxes on peasant farming and increased purchase prices on agricultural products. There began the development of new lands in Siberia and Kazakhstan. In that period, great success was achieved in the social policy of the USSR. Housing construction was actively developing. More than 50 million people received new apartments. Salaries of workers and employees increased.

Great success in space exploration was achieved by Soviet designer S.P. Korolev. In 1957, under his leadership, the world's first artificial Earth satellite was created. On April 12, 1961, Yu.A. Gagarin made the world's first manned space flight. The first female cosmonaut was V.V. Tereshkova. Moreover, the first spacewalk of man was also first made by a Soviet cosmonaut –it was A. A.

                                            In the post-war period, a new impetus was given to the creative work of the artistic intelligentsia, including in the national republics. Poet R.G. Gamzatov, writer Ch.T. Aitmatov and others were well-known in the USSR. There appeared many new poets - A. Voznesensky, E Yevtushenko, R. Rozhdestvensky and others. Soviet writers B. L. Pasternak, M. A. Sholokhov, A. I. Solzhenitsyn, poet I. A. Brodsky were awarded the Nobel Prize.

                                            Soviet cinema entered a new stage in its development. An important place was occupied by the theme of the Great Patriotic War (the films “The Cranes Are Flying,” “Ballad of a Soldier,” “Fate of a Man”).

                                            Important changes occurred in architecture. After the war, there began active construction of buildings (for example, Stalin’s high-risers (Seven Sisters). In Moscow, there were also built the Kremlin Palace of Congresses and the Ostankino Television Tower (its height - 553 meters).

                                            Particular attention in those years was paid to the memory of the Great Patriotic War. In honor of the Great Victory monumental ensembles were created in different cities of the USSR.)

                                        During the perestroika period, the task was set to accelerate the pace of economic development. Enterprises gained economic independence and the right to conduct foreign economic activity. There began the revival of the private sector of the economy through the development of cooperative movement. There was developing the individual labor activity of citizens in various fields. However, the reforms were not accomplished. At the end of perestroika, an economic crisis began in the country.

                                            In the USSR there was carried out the reform of the political system. A multi-party system began to take shape in the USSR. In addition to the CPSU, new parties were formed - socialist, liberal, and national-patriotic ones.

                                            There were changes in the state system of the USSR. The Congress of People's Deputies started to work again. It was the supreme legislative body of the country. In 1989,the elections of deputies were held. For the first time, those were alternative elections, in which several candidates participated. The Congress formed the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (in fact, parliament).

                                            In March 1990, M.S. Gorbachev became the first President of the USSR. In 1991, presidential elections were held in the union republics, including Russia.

                                            At the end of perestroika, the economic and political situation in the country became worse. The crisis of communist ideology aggravated.

                                            At that time, national movements were developing in different republics - in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Armenia, Georgia, and Ukraine. The republics, including the RSFSR, adopted declarations of state sovereignty.

                                            In those conditions, M.S. Gorbachev set the task of reforming the USSR. In 1991 there was held a referendum in the USSR. At the referendum, most citizens voted in favor of preserving the USSR in a new form. However, the new agreement between the republics was not signed. In August 1991, the opponents of perestroika tried to stage a coup. After that event there were suspended the activities of the CPSU and all bodies of state power. In the USSR, the communist regime ceased to exist. It accelerated the collapse of the USSR, which occurred in December 1991.
