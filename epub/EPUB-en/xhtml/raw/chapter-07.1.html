An eight-hour working day was introduced;child labor was prohibited; equal rights of women and men were proclaimed.</p>

                    <p>In 1918, the church was separated from the state, and the school was separated from the church.</p>

                    <p>The Bolsheviks proclaimed the equality of all nations and nationalities and the right of nations to self-determination. In December 1917, Poland and Finland gained the right to independence. In January 1918, there was created the <span class="it">Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic</span> (RSFSR). In March 1918, Soviet Russia signed a peace agreement with Germany and came out of the First World War, which for other countries ended in November 1918.</p>

                    <p>However, after the Bolsheviks came to power, in Russia there broke out the Civil War. At the same time, other foreign states began to intervene in the internal life of Russia. The main military force in the fight against the Bolsheviks and Soviet power was the White Movement (White Army). The White Army consisted of former officers of the tsarist army and members of various political parties. It fought against the Red Army, which had been created by the Bolsheviks.</p>

                    <p>In 1921, the Civil War ended with the victory of the Bolsheviks. Soviet power was established in Central Asia and the Caucasus.</p>
