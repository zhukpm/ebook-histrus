                    <p>In <span class="emphasis">1861</span> , a great historic event took place in Russia. The tsar signed the manifesto on the abolition of serfdom. Millions of peasant serfs gained personal freedom.</p>

                    <p>A huge role in the preparation of the great reform was played by Emperor <span class="it">Alexander II</span> (1855-1881). His educational background, kindness and understanding of the interests of the country helped him make drastic transformations.</p>

                    <p>As a result of the reform, peasants gained civil rights and land. However, they had to pay money for the land. At the same time, it was the rural community that was considered the formal owner of the land. It distributed land among peasants. The community was responsible for the order and collection of taxes.</p>

                    <p>The great reform of 1861 accelerated the country's capitalist development and proved that it was possible to carry out important transformations in Russia peacefully. However, there were considered the interests of landowners and the state rather than those of peasants. Landowners had large estates, and peasants had less and less land. There were still peasant communities in villages.</p>

                    <p>Alexander II carried out other reforms as well - the reform of local self-government (<span class="it">Zemsky</span> reform), the <span class="it">judicial</span> reform, which introduced the formal equality of all estates before the law and the independence of the court; the <span class="it">military</span> reform. The army abolished corporal punishment, introduced universal conscription; the term of military service was reduced from 25 to 6 years.</p>

                    <p>As a result of the reforms in the country, there were quickly developing capitalist relations. However, the establishment of the capitalist market led to the worsening of living conditions of a significant part of peasants.</p>
