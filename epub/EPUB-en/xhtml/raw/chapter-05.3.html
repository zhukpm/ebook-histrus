                        In <span class="emphasis">1861</span>
                        , a great historic event took place in Russia. The tsar signed the manifesto on the
                        abolition of serfdom. Millions of peasant serfs gained personal freedom.

                        A huge role in the preparation of the great reform was played by Emperor <span class="it">Alexander II</span>

                        (1855-1881). His educational background, kindness and understanding of the interests of the
                        country helped him make drastic transformations.

                    <p>
                        As a result of the reform, peasants gained civil rights and land. However, they had to pay money
                        for the land. At the same time, it was the rural community that was considered the formal owner
                        of the land. It distributed land among peasants. The community was responsible for the order and
                        collection of taxes.

                        The great reform of 1861 accelerated the country's capitalist development and proved that it was
                        possible to carry out important transformations in Russia peacefully. However, there were
                        considered the interests of landowners and the state rather than those of peasants. Landowners
                        had large estates, and peasants had less and less land. There were still peasant communities in
                        villages.
