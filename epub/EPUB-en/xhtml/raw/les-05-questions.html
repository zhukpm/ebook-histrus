                                        Russian emperor Alexander I was an educated and smart ruler, but during his reign there was the war with Napoleon, which distracted from internal transformations. It was the peasant issue that remained the main problem of the domestic policy during the reign of Alexander I. The emperor limited serfdom and stopped giving peasants to landowners. From 1803, serfs were allowed to gain freedom and land for money if the landowner did not object. However, Alexander I did not dare to abolish serfdom. After the victory over Napoleon (1814), the tsar - winner of Napoleon, liberator of Europe — abandoned any reforms, which led to the return of the former practices: for example, landowners regained the right to exile their peasants to penal servitude to Siberia; there increased censorship. The tsar did not implement the reforms he had promised.

                                        <p>On June 12, 1812, the half-million army of Napoleon, emperor of France, crossed the borders of Russia. The Russian army was half as little and it was divided into separate armies. Napoleon, who before invading Russia had conquered the whole of Europe, planned to defeat the Russian armies separately. However, they united near Smolensk, and Emperor Alexander I appointed M.I. Kutuzov Commander-in-Chief. Peasants began to rise up against the enemy; they formed partisan detachments, that is, the whole people fought against the invaders. It became the nation-wide war for the motherland, that is a patriotic war.

Napoleon entered Moscow, in which fires began. There was no food, and the French began to pillage civilians. The "Great Army," as Napoleon called it, was turning into a gang of looters. Napoleon understood it perfectly and therefore tried to make peace with Russia, but Alexander did not accept his proposal. Napoleon left Moscow. Two months later, there was practically nothing left of the French army. On December 25, 1812, Emperor Alexander I issued the manifesto on the end of the Patriotic war. It united Russian society and caused the national conscious-raising.</p>

                                        <p>The uprising of the noblemen-Decembrists took place in December 1825, hence the name “Decembrists”. Almost all the Decembrists were officers who, together with their soldiers, had liberated Russia and Western Europe from Napoleon. For them, as the liberators, it was a matter of honor to free their own people from serfdom and autocracy. The government’s refusal to carry out reforms prompted the Decembrists to create secret organizations. The “Northern Society” in St. Petersburg planned to introduce limited, constitutional monarchy, to eliminate serfdom, to introduce rights and freedoms for citizens guaranteed by law. The “Southern Society” planned to eliminate autocracy, to establish the republic, to introduce equal rights for all citizens.

It was the first organized uprising against autocracy and serfdom. Surprisingly it was noblemen that tried to change the existing situation in Russia, despite the fact that they benefitted from those practices.</p>

                                        Emperor Nicholas I (1825-1855) was a soldier in spirit; above all, he valued power, faith and national spirit. However, he was afraid of radical changes, which he perceived as a threat to the country and himself. He realized that serfdom hampered the development of the country, but he did not dare to abolish it because of the fear of social upheaval. Under Nicholas I, the position of state peasants improved: their land holdings increased, rural schools and hospitals were opened. In 1853-1856, Russia waged the Crimean War against Turkey, England and France, which it lost, and the defeat in the war proved Russia's economic lag behind Western European states and eventually forced the preparation of reforms in the country.

                                        In 1861, a great historic event took place: serfdom was abolished. Millions of peasant serfs gained freedom. Emperor Alexander II (1855-1881), who was an educated person and understood the country's interests, played a huge role in the preparation and implementation of the “great reform”. The abolition of serfdom showed that it was possible to carry out radical reforms in Russia by peaceful means. Emperor Alexander II also carried out other liberal reforms: there were created zemstvos - local self-government bodies; the judicial reform was carried out - from then on all estates received equal rights before the law, and the court became independent; the military reform was carried out - corporal punishment was abolished, there were introduced universal conscription and 6-year military service. There began the period of capitalist industrialization.

                                        It can be noted that the XIX century was the “Golden Age” of Russian culture. Universities, female gymnasiums and institutes were opened. Russian literature gave the world such geniuses as Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky ... And these are just a few names! The Russian science of the XIX century went down in history with the names of great chemist Mendeleev, the creator of the periodic system of chemical elements, radio engineer Popov, the creator of the first radio receiver, physiologist Pavlov. The music of great Russian composers Musorgsky, Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Rakhmaninov is still performed in the best concert halls of the world.
