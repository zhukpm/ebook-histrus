                    <p>The Patriotic War of 1812 took place during the reign of <span class="it">Alexander I</span> (1801-1825). He was an educated and smart ruler, but lack of staunchness prevented him from implementing the reforms sought. He reigned in the conditions of war, which required huge costs and distracted from internal transformations.</p>

                    <p>Above all, Alexander I tried to solve the peasant issue. He forbade giving state peasants to landowners (1801), which limited serfdom. In 1803, he allowed serfs to gain freedom and land for money, but with the consent of a landowner. Serfs in the Baltics gained personal freedom. However, Alexander I did not dare to abolish <a class="kInteractive link link220" data-kotobee="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" href="">serfdom</a>.</p>

                    <p>With regard to the <span class="it">foreign policy</span> , in that period there occurred the expansion of the territory of the Russian Empire. At the very beginning of the XIX century, Christian Georgia became part of the country. It feared that it might be captured by the Islamic states (Iran and Turkey). After the victory over Iran, the territories of Dagestan and Northern Azerbaijan were annexed to Russia.</p>

                    <p>Of particular importance for Russia was the European direction. When Napoleon, who was trying to establish his dominance in Europe, came to power in France, the international situation got complicated. Russia in alliance with England and Austria stood up to Napoleon. Napoleon began to prepare for the war against Russia.</p>

                    <p><span class="emphasis">On June 12, 1812</span> , the huge Napoleon’s army (450 thousand people) crossed the borders of Russia. The Russian troops were inferior in quantity (300 thousand people); moreover, they were divided into separate armies. Napoleon planned to defeat them separately and subjugate Russia.</p>

Peasants, townspeople, representatives of different nationalities began to rise against the invaders. The war became <span class="it">patriotic</span> .</p>

                    <p>Given the patriotic rise in the army, Kutuzov decided to give the enemy a decisive battle. On <span class="emphasis">August 26, 1812</span> , there began the <span class="it">Battle of Borodino</span> , known as the bloodiest in the history of the Napoleonic Wars. Both parties suffered heavy losses. Napoleon was not able to defeat the Russian army. But the Russian troops had no strength to continue the battle either. By Kutuzov’s order, they left Moscow.</p>

                    <p>Napoleon entered Moscow, and from that moment fires began in the city. Not having enough food, the French began to pillage the civilians. Napoleon tried to make peace with Russia, but Alexander I did not accept his proposal. Then Napoleon left Moscow and began a retreat southward. At that time, partisan detachments fought against Napoleon. In the battle near the Berezina River (November 28), the French army was virtually defeated. On December 25, Alexander I issued a manifesto on the end of the Patriotic war.</p>

                    <p>In January 1813, the Russian troops crossed the border and, with the support of the allied armies (Prussia and Austria had sided with Russia), defeated Napoleon. The Patriotic War of 1812 rallied the Russian society and caused the national conscious-raising.</p>
