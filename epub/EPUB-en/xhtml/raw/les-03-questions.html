                                        The crisis in Russian society, which was popularly called the “Time of Troubles”, was caused by the policy of oprichnina: aggravation of the economic situation in the country, tax increase, enslavement of peasants, which led to the civil war and Polish intervention. After the death of Ivan the Terrible and his son Fyodor Ivanovich, who had no children, there began the period of interregnum, there were many tsars; there was a war of all against all.

                                        In 1591, Tsarevich Dmitry, the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible, accidentally died. He could have assumed the throne after the death of his elder brother, Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich. After the death of Tsar Fyodor, the Zemsky Sobor elected Boris Godunov to the throne; he had ruled the country in Tsar Fyodor’s lifetime. He was the first elected Russian Tsar. Tsar Boris was a smart and honest politician. However, in 1601 and 1602, the crops were lost in the country; there was a terrible famine. Among the people, there arose a rumor about the miraculous salvation of Tsar Dmitry, who would save the people and the country from the famine and would restore order and justice. The impostors called themselves Tsarevich Dmitry. Later people called them False Dmitrys. The Poles, who supported them and plundered the country, aroused the hatred of the people. As a result, both the first and second impostors were assassinated.

                                        The second half of the XVII century was the time of the strengthening of autocracy. The central power was strengthened. The new tsars from the Romanov dynasty discussed all important state issues with people close to them, rather than with the Boyar Duma; and they did not convene the Zemsky Sobor. From that time on, a crime against the tsar’s personality was considered a crime against the state.

                                        The XVII century was called the century of riots, the century of popular unrest. The most serious uprising was the Moscow uprising of 1648, after the government had raised the price for salt. The most famous popular uprising was the one led by Stepan Razin (1667-1671). That popular war involved Cossacks and peasants who had fled from serfdom from central Russia to the river Don. The uprising ended in the complete defeat and execution of its leaders.
