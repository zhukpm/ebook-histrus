                    <p>Russia's foreign policy is aimed at protecting its national interests. In the new environment, Russia and China oppose the global leadership of the USA in the world. Russia did not support the USA military operation in Iraq in 2003. In 2013, Russia won a diplomatic victory and prevented the USA from the military invasion of Syria.</p>

                    <p>The USA set a goal to include the former Soviet republics, primarily the Baltic States, Georgia and Ukraine, in the sphere of its influence. This brings the world back to the days of the Cold War and the struggle of the two systems.</p>

                    <p>At present, there are disagreements in Russian-American relations on Syrian issues, on the recognition of independence of South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and the situation in Ukraine.</p>

                    <p>Within the CIS, there are difficulties and contradictions. Since the beginning of 2014, the political events in Ukraine have complicated Russian-Ukrainian relations. Under these conditions, the Russian state came out in defense of the Russian-speaking population of Crimea and the regions of Eastern Ukraine. On March 16, 2014, a referendum was held in Crimea. Almost 97% of the electors voted for the accession of Crimea to Russia (until 1954 Crimea had been its part). On <span class="emphasis">March 18, 2014</span> in Moscow, the agreement was signed on the accession of the Republic of Crimea to the Russian Federation.</p>

                    <p>Despite the existing contradictions with the USA and Western countries, Russia is committed to developing a constructive dialogue with foreign partners in the field of international security and the fight against global terrorism. It is the United Nations that Russia considers as the main coordinating body in solving problems common to all humanity. Interaction within the framework of such organizations as the BRICS and the SCO remains an important area of modern foreign policy of the Russian Federation.</p>
