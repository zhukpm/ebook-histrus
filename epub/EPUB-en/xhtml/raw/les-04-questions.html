                                        At the end of the XVII century, Russia considerably lagged behind Western Europe, which threatened its security. To overcome the economic, military and cultural backwardness, it was necessary to carry out reforms and establish trade relations with Europe. However, it was impossible without access to the Baltic Sea. Tsar Peter I (1682-1725), tsar-worker, began to solve those problems. His primary goal was to serve the interests of the state. Peter I could appreciate people’s business qualities, regardless of their origin, but he was a tough and even cruel man in solving the tasks set; he spared neither himself nor others.)

                                        In 1700, Russia began the Great Northern War against Sweden for the access to the Baltic Sea, which lasted until 1721. During the war years, Peter I created a new army and navy, transformed the state’s management system, culture and life of the country. During his reign, industry was created and successfully developed. The tsar allowed industrialists (even commoners) to buy serfs to work at plants. The state changed the role of public service in the life of the nobility, since only the eldest son could inherit the estate, and all the others had to go to the public service. There was introduced a new tax that all men had to pay regardless of age (except for noblemen and priests). Thus, the taxes became even heavier for the people. In order to prevent serfs from fleeing from the landowners, there was introduced a passport system. After defeating Sweden in 1721, Peter I assumed the title of emperor, and Russia became an empire. The power of Peter I became unlimited; he got the right to appoint his successor himself.

                                        Empress Catherine, called “the Great” by the contemporaries, was a smart ruler. She loved Russia, believed in education and dreamed of strengthening Russia's position in the world. She was not a supporter of serfdom, but she realized that its abolition could dethrone her. Therefore, during her reign serfdom did strengthen. Peter I, as a great reformer, was an example for her, but she did not follow the harsh methods of his domestic policy.

                                        The socio-economic policy of Catherine II was contradictory: the serfdom was strengthened (she “gave” state(free) peasants to landlords), but at the same time, representatives of all the estates got the right to do business. Under Catherine II, noblemen got privileges: monopoly on land and peasants and exemption from compulsory public service, which had been introduced by Peter the Great. Therefore, in history the era of the reign of Catherine II is called the "Golden Age" of the Russian nobility.

                                        During the reign of Catherine II, Russia expanded its borders and gained access to the Black Sea, annexed the Crimean peninsula, where the Black Sea Fleet base was established (Sevastopol).Together with the new lands in the south (Novorossiya / New Russia), Russia opened new trade routes that were necessary for its economic development. The territory of Russia in the west was expanded as well. The role of Russia in world politics increased, which gave contemporaries the ground to call their empress Catherine the Great.

                                        <p>The changes in Russia’s life introduced by Emperor Peter the Great led to a break with the traditions and to expansion of ties with the countries of Western Europe. Under Peter I, special schools were created in Russia that trained specialists for the army and navy. In 1725, there was founded the Academy of Sciences. From 1700, Russia switched to the European chronology - from the birth of Christ, and New Year began not on September 1, but on January 1.</p><p>
                                        In 1755, according to the project of great Russian scientist M.V. Lomonosov, there was founded Moscow University where people of all estates could study. Under Catherine the Great, public schools were opened in each of the 50provinces, but serfs’ children had no opportunity to study there. In 1750, in Yaroslavl there appeared the first Russian professional theater. Thus, Russia became one of the great cultural powers, which was promoted by Empress Catherine, who was one of the most educated people of her time.</p>
