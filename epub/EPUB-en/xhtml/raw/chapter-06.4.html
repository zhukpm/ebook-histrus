                    <p>At the beginning of the XX century, important changes took place in the culture of Russia.</p>

                    <p>The education system was developing. There were more public, <span class="it">vocational</span> (mining, river, railway) and <span class="it">commercial</span> schools. There were established new private and state institutions and universities, above all, technical ones.</p>

                    <p>Due to the development of industry, natural and technical sciences were developing rapidly. <span class="it">V.I. Vernadsky</span> laid the foundations of modern ecology. <span class="it">I.I. Mechnikov</span> created the theory of immunity and developed various forms of combating infectious diseases. He became a Nobel Prize winner in medicine.</p>

                    <p>Significant success was achieved by <span class="it">N. E. Zhukovsky</span> , the founder of aerodynamics. There began the rise of aircraft and automotive industries.</p>

                    <p>Russian literature was developing. It reflected the social and psychological problems, which were touched upon in the works of <span class="it">A.P. Chekhov</span> (the plays “The Seagull”, “The Three Sisters”, “The Cherry Orchard”), <span class="it">M. Gorky</span> (the play “Enemies”, the novel “Mother”). In his poems S.A. Yesenin praised Russian village and peasantry.</p>

                    <p>At the same time, new literary trends appeared in poetry. Their representatives, <span class="it">A.A. Blok</span> , <span class="it">A. Bely</span> , <span class="it">M.I. Tsvetaeva</span> , created new lyric poetry, which revealed the feelings of people. This period is called the Silver Age of Russian poetry.</p>

At the same time, there appeared new trends in the paintings of Russian artists <span class="it">M.V. Nesterov</span> , <span class="it">V.A. Serov</span> , <span class="it">M.A. Vrubel</span> .</p>

                    <p>They revealed people’s spiritual world.</p>

                    <p>Among the composers, it was <span class="it">S.V. Rachmaninov</span> , <span class="it">I.F. Stravinsky</span> , <span class="it">A.N. Scriabin</span> that were very popular. <span class="it">F.I. Chaliapin</span> was the world famous opera singer.</p>

                    <p>Russian theatrical art developed. The most famous were opera and ballet theaters - the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow and the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg. They are still very popular in Russia and worldwide.</p>

                    <p>The <span class="it">Russian ballet</span> won international acclaim. The Russian ballet dancers performed in Europe, North and South America.</p>

                    <p>The general results of the development of Russian culture at the beginning of the XX century testify to its heyday. An important place in the works of the Russian cultural figures was occupied by the national and historical traditions. This contributed to the development of national identity. At the same time, Russian culture became the essential part of world culture.</p>
