                                        The East Slavs were the tribes of the Slavs who from ancient times inhabited Central and Eastern Europe. They were engaged in agriculture and cattle breeding.

                                        The city of Kiev, the largest city of Ancient Rus, became the economic and political center of the East Slavs. The East Slavs and their neighbors paid tribute to the Prince of Kiev, and when in 988 Prince Vladimir introduced a single religion, Christianity, the Old Russian state was finally formed.

                                        Ancient Rus reached its heyday under Yaroslav the Wise (1019-1054), the son of Prince Vladimir. Under Yaroslav, the international authority of Rus grew and culture developed.

                                        After the death of Prince Yaroslav the Wise and the division of his lands, there began the period of political fragmentation. By the end of the XII century, instead of a single Old Russian state, 15 principalities had appeared (the Principality of Kiev, Vladimir-Suzdal principality, the Principality of Smolensk, etc.) with the common faith and language. There were intestine wars among the princes. The political fragmentation weakened Rus.

                                        Rus became part of the Golden Horde, but it retained its internal practices; its economic dependence was limited to paying tribute. The political dependence was that the Russian princes gained from the Golden Horde khan the right to reign.
