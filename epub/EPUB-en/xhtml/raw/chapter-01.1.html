                    <p>From ancient times, the tribes of Slavs lived in the territory of Central and Eastern Europe. In
                        the VII-VIII centuries, the East Slavs, the ancestors of the modern Russian, Ukrainian, and
                        Belarusian peoples, separated from a single community. They explored the vast forest areas of
                        Eastern Europe, where Finnish and Baltic tribes lived. In the east, their neighbors were Turkic
                        peoples (Volga Bulgars, Polovtsy, etc.). The East Slavs were <span class="it">farmers</span>
                        , but they were also
                        involved in <span class="it">cattle breeding</span>
                        , <span class="it">hunting</span>
                         and <span class="it">fishing</span>
                         . In the IX-X centuries, there appeared the
                        Slavs’ towns. They were mainly located along the banks of rivers, and they gradually became
                        centers of trade and craft (the manufacture of iron tools, pottery, fabrics, etc.). The largest
                        city was Kiev. It stood on the Dnieper River, on which the main trade route passed. Due to its
                        location, Kiev became a major economic and political center of the East Slavs. From the end of
                        the IX century, princes from the Rurik dynasty came there with their druzhinas (professional
                        military).

                        Kiev became the capital of the Old Russian state. In the X century, the power of the Kiev
                        princes spread to the territories inhabited by the East Slavs and other neighboring tribes. All
                        of them paid tribute (tax) to the Kiev prince, who protected them from enemies. Under the
                        leadership of the princes, military campaigns were waged against rich Byzantium (it was the name
                        of the Eastern Roman Empire, which had a capital - the city of Byzantium (Constantinople) – now
                        Istanbul). The successful campaigns strengthened the financial position and power of the prince
                        with his druzhina and contributed to the development of foreign trade. At the same time, Ancient
                        Rus was formed on the East Slavic basis with the participation of other peoples (Normans,
                        Khazars, etc.), i.e. it was originally a multinational state.

                        The Old Russian state was finally formed at the end of the X century, during the reign of <span class="it">St.

                        The Old Russian state protected the land from the attacks of nomads and provided favorable
                        conditions for the development of European states. Thus, Rus became a kind of bridge that
                        connected the West and the East.
