                    <p>The USSR initially included the RSFSR, Ukraine, Byelorussia, as well as the Transcaucasian republics (Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan). In 1924, the first USSR Constitution was adopted.

There were established <span class="it">All-Union</span> public authorities: the executive body - the government, which was called the Sovnarkom (Council of People's Commissars) of the USSR (from 1946 - the Council of Ministers of the USSR), and the legislative body - the All-Union Congress of Soviets(from 1936 - the Supreme Council of the USSR (parliament)). Each republic also had its own (republican) authorities.</p>

                    <p>There appeared Soviet symbols - the flag and coat of arms of the USSR.</p>

                    <p>They depicted a red star, a sickle and a hammer. The state coat of arms of the USSR symbolized the union of workers and peasants, the voluntary association of equal union republics.</p>

                    <p>In 1943, the USSR anthem was approved (the lyrics were written by <span class="it">S.V. Mikhalkov</span> and <span class="it">G.A. El-Registan</span> (the real name is <span class="it">G.A. Ureklyan</span> ); the music was composed by <span class="it">A.V. Aleksandrov</span> ). The music of the USSR anthem later became the anthem of modern Russia.</p>

                    <p>During the 1920-1930s within the territory of Central Asia there were formed the Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik, Kyrgyz, Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republics (SSR); in Transcaucasia - the Armenian, Azerbaijan and Georgian SSR. Later, the USSR included the three Baltic republics and the Moldavian SSR.</p>

                    <p>The formation of the USSR helped to develop the economy, education, and culture in the new republics.</p>

                    <p>The USSR was a multinational state, with more than 120 languages. Formally, in the USSR there were no official or state languages (with the exception of Armenia and Georgia), and all the languages of the USSR were equal in their rights. National schools and theaters were opened in all the republics, and literature was published in the languages of the peoples of the USSR. There appeared national intelligentsia. In the republics, national academies of sciences were created.</p>

                    <p>At the same time, in the USSR it was the Russian language that was the language of <span class="it">interethnic communication</span> through which representatives of different ethnic groups within one multinational state communicated with each other.</p>

                    <p>The Soviet national policy was controversial. On the one hand, national differences persisted, friendship between peoples strengthened, economic, cultural, kin relations grew, and the number of interethnic marriages increased. On the other hand, national relations were affected by the policy of centralization, restriction of the powers of the republics, and strict subordination to their party leadership. Despite these problems, the USSR retained its strength as a single state until 1991. The peoples of the USSR together overcame difficulties and tragedies; they made a joint contribution to the victory in the Great Patriotic War.</p>
