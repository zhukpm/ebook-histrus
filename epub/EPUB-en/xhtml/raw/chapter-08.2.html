                    <p>The population helped the Soviet troops under the slogan "Everything for the front, everything for the victory!" The main food bases during the war years were the districts of the Volga region, Siberia, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia. The Russian Orthodox Church and representatives of other religious denominations strengthened the spirit of the Red Army and provided it with material assistance.</p>

                    <p>In the occupied territory, Nazi Germany resorted to terror. There were created concentration camps. Nazi Germany pursued the policy of slaughter of the Slavic and Jewish population. In total, in the occupied territories about seven million civilians and about four million prisoners of war died. More than five million people were taken away for work to Germany.</p>
