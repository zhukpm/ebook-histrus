                    <p>The renunciation of Alexander I to carry out reforms led to the fact that part of the liberal nobility decided to oppose the power of the tsar (autocracy).</p>

                    <p>In December <span class="emphasis">1825</span> , there took place an uprising of the noblemen-revolutionaries (hence their name <span class="it">Decembrists</span> ). Almost all Decembrists were officers who together with soldiers had liberated Russia and Western Europe from Napoleon. Their main aim was to save the Russian people from serfdom and autocracy.</p>

                    <p>The noblemen no longer believed the tsar. They began to create secret organizations.</p>

                    <p>The “Southern Society” led by <span class="it">P.I. Pestel</span> and <span class="it">S.I. Muravyov-Apostol</span> operated in Ukraine. The society planned to eliminate autocracy and serfdom, to establish the republic, and give equal rights to all citizens.</p>

                    <p>The “Northern Society” led by <span class="it">N.M. Muravyov</span> and <span class="it">K.F. Ryleyev</span> operated in St. Petersburg. This society advocated the introduction of constitutional monarchy (that is, the power of the tsar limited by the constitution), the abolition of serfdom; it also advocated the rights and freedoms of citizens.</p>

                    <p>In November 1825, Alexander I died. The secret societies decided to take advantage of his death. They planned to assemble guard regiments in the Senate Square and force the Senate to adopt “The Manifesto to the Russian People” on the introduction of freedoms.</p>

                    <p>On December 14, about 3 and a half thousand rebels gathered in the Senate Square in St. Petersburg (where the monument to Peter I is located). New emperor <span class="it">Nicholas I</span> (1825-1855) found out about the plans of the revolutionaries and surrounded the square with loyal troops. They began to fire guns and shoot at the rebels. Then mass arrests began. Five leaders of the uprising were hanged. Many rebels were exiled to Siberia.</p>

                    <p>The Decembrist uprising was the first organized armed rebellion against autocracy and serfdom. Its peculiarity lay in the fact that it was noblemen that wanted to change the existing practices in Russia, despite the fact that they occupied a privileged position in society.</p>

                    <p>On the contrary, Emperor Nicholas I wanted to strengthen the autocracy, to prevent revolution in Russia and accelerate the development of the country.</p>

Under Nicholas I, the position of state peasants improved: their land holdings increased; there were opened rural schools and hospitals. In 1851, there was opened the Petersburg-Moscow railway. In general, during the reign of Nicolas I, the state control over all spheres of life intensified, which hindered the development of the country.</p>

                    <p>Under Nicholas I, after the successful wars against Persia and Turkey, the territory of Eastern Armenia became part of Russia, and at the end of the XIX century, significant territories of Western Armenia integrated into Russia. The Russian authorities organized mass resettlement of Armenians from Persia and Turkey to Transcaucasia.</p>

                    <p>In the second half of the XIX century, the most important international event for Russia was the <span class="it">Crimean War</span> <span class="emphasis">(1853-1856)</span> . It was caused by the struggle of the European powers for the partition of Turkey’s territory. In that war Russia was opposed by the coalition of the leading European states (France and England) as well as Turkey. Therefore, it was defeated.
