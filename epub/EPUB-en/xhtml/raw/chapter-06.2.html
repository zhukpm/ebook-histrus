                        The revolution began at the factories and plants of St. Petersburg <span class="emphasis">in January 1905</span>
                        . On the
                        morning of January 9 (it was Sunday), ordinary people went to the tsar’s palace with a request
                        to improve their living standards. The police blocked the way and began to shoot at unarmed
                        people. This day was called "Bloody Sunday" because there were injured and killed many people.

                        In Russia, there began to intensify the revolutionary struggle of the people against the tsar
                        and his government.
                         </p>
                    <p>
                        During the revolution, workers demanded an eight-hour workday, democratic freedoms; peasants
                        demanded a solution to the problem of land. The military in the army were discontented that
                        Russia had lost the Russo-Japanese war.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        Especially a lot of people (two million people) participated in the strikes in October. There
                        were people’s actions against the emperor and the government all over Russia. Therefore, this
                        process was called the “All-Russian October Political Strike”. Throughout Russia, there began
                        actions of workers and peasants.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the influence of people’s actions, on October <span class="emphasis">17, 1905</span>
                         Emperor Nicholas II signed the
                        <span class="emphasis">Manifesto</span>
                        . It proclaimed freedom of speech, press and assembly; it allowed creating parties and
                        unions. For the first time in the history of the country there began to operate a legislative
                        body - the Russian parliament, which was called the <span class="it">State Duma</span>
                        . There were created all-Russian
                        liberal political parties (Kadets, Octobrists) and monarchist organizations. Liberals opposed
                        the revolution; they advocated democratic reforms. Monarchists defended the absolute power of
                        the monarch and Russian national traditions.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        By June 1907, the revolutionary movement had weakened. Thus, the First Russian revolution was
                        over. The most important result of the revolution was the creation of the State Duma. Workers
                        gained the right to create trade unions and conduct economic strikes. The agrarian reform began.
                        However, the autocracy and landholding of landowners remained, albeit limited. Peasants
                        continued to oppose landlords, and the working class and intelligentsia advocated extension of
                        political freedoms.
