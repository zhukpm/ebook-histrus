                    <p> The nature of the development of Russian culture was determined by Orthodoxy, which came from
                        Byzantium. Religion influenced the spread of writing (the very appearance of writing in Rus was
                        associated with the activities of the brothers Cyril and Methodius at the end of the IX century.
                        They created the Slavic alphabet - the Cyrillic alphabet, based on which the modern Russian
                        alphabet arose).


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the XI century, there appeared translations of church and secular books. At monasteries,
                        schools were opened. Literacy was widespread among the urban population.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most important phenomenon of Rus culture was <span class="it">chronicles</span>
                        . The author of the most famous one -
                        <span class="it">"The Tale of Bygone Years"</span>
                         (1113) was monk <span class="it">Nestor</span>
                         . Russian chronicles were written in the native
                        language, while in Western Europe, books were written in Latin - the language that was foreign
                        to the people.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most famous literary monument of Ancient Rus is the <span class="it">"Tale of Igor's Campaign"</span>
                         (the end of
                        the XII century). Its author opposed the intestine wars that weakened Rus in the fight against
                        external enemies, and called for the unity of the Russian lands.

                        In ancient Rus, architecture and art were developing.

                        In the XI century, the largest temples were built: <span class="it">the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kiev</span>
                         and <span class="it">the
                        Cathedral of St. Sophia in Novgorod</span>

                        The religious symbol of Christianity is the cross (the cross symbolizes the crucifixion of Jesus
                        Christ).

                        The new religion became the spiritual foundation of the Russian people. The Orthodox Church not
                        only taught, but also educated Old Russian society and fought against pagan remnants. The
                        adoption of Orthodoxy by Rus influenced many features of its historical development.
