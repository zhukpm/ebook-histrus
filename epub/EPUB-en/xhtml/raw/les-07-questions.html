                                        <p>The Russian Revolution of 1917 had two stages. The revolution began in February-March 1917. Emperor Nicholas II abdicated the throne. Russia became not a monarchy, but a republic. There were established the new Provisional Government and the Council of Workers’ and Soldiers’ deputies, but Russia was still involved in the First World War.

                                        </p> <p>The people were still against the war. The Provisional Government did not carry out reforms. Life in the country became even worse. There began struggle against the Provisional Government. It was headed by V.I. Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik party. In October 1917, the Bolsheviks organized an armed uprising in Petrograd and Moscow. It was the second stage of the revolution (October Revolution), which ended with the victory of the Bolsheviks. The Provisional Government was overthrown. Instead, a new government was created, which was called the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) headed by V.I. Lenin. The Soviet power was established throughout the country.</p>

                                        <p>After the revolution, important socio-economic and political changes took place in Russia. There was no private property any more, land belonged to peasants; all plants, factories and banks were nationalized, and they belonged to the state. The new government passed a law stating that all nations and nationalities within Russia were equal.
                                            </p><p>In December 1922, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was formed. The following republics were included in the USSR: the RSFSR, the Ukrainian SSR, the Byelorussian SSR, the Transcaucasian republics (Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia). Later, the Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik, and Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republics entered the Soviet Union. Then the Baltic republics became part of the USSR: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and later - the Moldavian SSR.
                                        </p><p>The formation of the USSR was of great significance for the peoples of different republics: their economy developed, factories were built, national schools, theaters were opened; newspapers, magazines and literature began to be published in different languages of the peoples of the USSR. At the same time, the Russian language was the language of interethnic communication.)</p>

                                        After the Bolsheviks came to power, there broke out the Civil War in Russia (the war between citizens of Russia), as well as foreign intervention. Other states began to intervene in the internal life of Russia. The main military force in the fight against the Bolsheviks and the Soviet power was the White movement (the White Army).It mainly consisted of former Russian officers who had served in the tsarist army. In order to fight against the White Army, the Bolsheviks created the Red Army, which was composed of workers and peasants. The Red Army defeated the White Army. The Civil War ended in 1921.

                                        Industrialization changed the life and economy of all Soviet national republics. There were built new plants and factories, new canals, railways and power plants. New industries emerged: automobile, chemical, aircraft, and others. In terms of industrial production, the Soviet Union ranked second in the world after the USA, but the successes were achieved at the cost of the hard work of the whole people.

                                        <p>After the revolution and the Civil War, in the agriculture of all republics of the USSR great changes took place. In the 1930s, there began collectivization in the country. Collectivization meant the creation of large collective farms (kolkhozes).
                                            </p><p>Collective farms received machinery for work (cars, tractors). Workers from towns helped peasants to work with machines. However, the situation in the collective farms was very difficult. There were many problems: the production of grain, milk and meat decreased. At that time, famine began in villages. There was applied repression against peasants. Therefore, collectivization in the USSR was difficult. The situation in villages improved only in the second half of the 1930s.</p>

                                        After the death of V.I. Lenin in 1924, J.V. Stalin became the leader of the USSR. At that time, there was a rigid system of power in the country. In the Soviet Union there was only one party - the Bolshevik party; from 1952 it began to be called the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). J.V. Stalin was at the head of the party. This party controlled the whole society and all people. Especially strong was the personal power of J.V. Stalin. This form of power is called the "personality cult." At that time, there were repressions against various sectors of society. Many people died.

                                            After the revolution and the formation of the USSR, there began to actively develop Soviet culture, which was multinational. At that time, famous Soviet writers(M. Gorky, M. Sholokhov, M. Bulgakov and others), as well as talented Soviet poets (V. Mayakovsky, S. Yesenin, etc.) created many wonderful works.

                                            Cinema and theater were also developing rapidly. There were made many interesting films and performances. Certainly, one should mention the development of music culture (S.S. Prokofiev, A.I. Khachaturian, D.D. Shostakovich). Soviet ballet continued the traditions of Russian ballet; it was the best ballet in the world.
