                    <p> By the end of the XII century, there had emerged about 15 small states-principalities(the
                        Principality of Kiev, Vladimir-Suzdal principality, the Principality of Chernigov, the
                        Principality of Smolensk and other principalities, as well as Novgorod Land). However, there
                        remained close ties between individual principalities thanks to the common faith and language.
                        In general, the political fragmentation weakened Rus.

                        North-Eastern Rus (Vladimir-Suzdal principality) got out of Kiev’s rule in the 30s of the XII
                        century under Prince <span class="it">Yuri Dolgoruky</span>
                         (he got this name for interfering in the affairs of the
                        neighboring principalities). He is considered the founder of Moscow (<span class="emphasis">1147</span>
                         - the first mention of
                        Moscow in the annals). After the death of Yuri Dolgoruky, the power passed to his son <span class="it">Andrei
                        Bogolyubsky</span>
                         (1157-1174). He moved the capital to Vladimir and wanted to turn it into the center
                        of all Russian lands. This is evidenced by the construction of the <span class="it">Assumption Cathedral</span>
                         there,
                        which was higher than the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kiev.

                        In the North-West of Rus, there was situated Novgorod. It was the largest trade center.
                        Novgorodians sold furs, honey, leather and other goods to European countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the beginning of the XII century, Novgorodians achieved complete independence. Therefore, the
                        city was called Free Novgorod. The supreme authority there was the veche (assembly). However,
                        Novgorod continued to invite princes from other lands to serve. At the same time, the prince
                        performed only military and police functions, but he did not have the right to interfere in the
                        internal affairs of the city management.
